## Introduction
Space-Time Finite Element Method is an alternative to the semi-discrete
approach using a time integration scheme for solving transient partial
differential equation (e.g. the heat equation). The difference to the semi-discrete
approach is that the time is considered as a dimension and the weak form
is formulated accordingly. The shape functions are a tensor product of the
spatial shape functions and the temporal shape function (e.g. the 1d problem
has 2d finite elements with x(space) and t(time) dependencies).

### Advantages of Space-Time FEM:
* Using high-order basis functions for space and time discretization leads to an approximation with a higher accuracy
* Offers the possibility of exploitation of HPC.
* Allows local refinement in space and time.

## This Project
This project shows an implementation of the Space-Time Finite Element Method to solve a transient heat diffusive problem. The implemented program is a stand-alone object-oriented Python code, which solves a problem in semi-discrete approach or using the Space-Time Finite Element Method (STFEM).

## Theory
The transient heat equation being solved is as follows:

![Equation1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial&space;T}{\partial&space;t}&space;-&space;\kappa&space;\frac{\partial^2&space;T}{\partial&space;x^2}&space;=&space;f(x,t))

where T is the temperature, c is the heat capacity, and Îº is the heat conductivity. The conventional semi-discrete approach would be, after discretizing and applying the weak form,

![Equation2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\left(&space;\frac{c}{\Delta&space;t}&space;M_{ij}&space;&plus;&space;\theta&space;K_{ij}&space;\right)&space;\hat{T}_i^{k&plus;1}&space;=&space;\left(&space;\frac{c}{\Delta&space;t}&space;M_{ij}&space;-&space;(1-\theta)K_{ij}&space;\right)&space;\hat{T}_i^k&space;&plus;&space;(1&space;-&space;\theta)&space;f_i^k&space;&plus;&space;\theta&space;f_i^{k&plus;1},)

where $`T^k = \sum^{dofs}{N_i \hat{T}_i^k}`$ is the discretized temperature field, $`M_{ij}=\int{N_i N_j}`$ and $`K=\int{N_{i,x} N_{j,x}}`$ are the system matrices, and $`0 \leq \theta \leq 1`$ is a time integration scheme parameter. On the other hand, the space-time approach would be simply solving $`K_{ij} \hat{T}_i = F_i`$ on a 2D mesh, where the two dimensions are the spatial and the temporal axes, and
```math
K_{ij} = c \int_t{ \int_x{ \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial t} N_j ~dxdt } } ~+~ \kappa \int_t{ \int_x{ \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial x} \frac{\partial N_j}{\partial x} ~dxdt } }.
```

def u_an(x, t):
    return sin(2*pi*x)*sin(2*pi*t)
